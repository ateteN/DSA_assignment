# Algorithm Assignment 

## Description

In  Enterprise-Web-Development, this is a Python program that performs operations (addition, substraction, and Multiplication) on sparce maatrices, using files as input. The results are then saved into an output file

## Project Structure

## How to run?

change directory from the root to the src directory and run the file 'program.py' 

**steps**

**1** - `cd .\dsa\sparse_matrix\code\src\` 
**2** - `python3 program.py`
**3** - Copy and Paste your first and second file's path when prompted
**4** - Write the operation you want to perform (addition, substraction, multiplication)
**5** - Name the output file

Make sure the input matrices have the same dimensions Calculations won't work otherwise
